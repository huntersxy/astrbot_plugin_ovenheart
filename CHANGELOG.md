# Changelog

## 0.2.0

- Rename the plugin from `astrbot_plugin_persona` to `astrbot_plugin_ovenheart` (OvenHeart / 烤箱之心), including directory, API namespace and release artifact. The native 人格工坊 View stays in place. Copy legacy SQLite data into an empty new database without changing the original; do not run both plugin IDs concurrently.
- Add hybrid embedding/text habit retrieval with bounded model calls, model/content cache invalidation, lexical fallback and free lexical previews.
- Accumulate independent source evidence, consolidate same-category habits, refine jargon at batch thresholds and preserve manual decisions. Add learning snapshots, reversible explicit ratings and send-stage reference records.
- Fix JSON errors from explanatory text, code fences, reasoning blocks and alternate schemas; add one bounded format correction using the original evidence, while still rejecting fabricated evidence directly.
- Exercise normal learning and correction through a real AstrBot OpenAI provider with cn:deepseek-v4-flash and synthetic messages. No QQ delivery or whole-system superiority claim is made.

## 0.1.0

- Add session/persona-scoped learning of personality tendencies, expression styles, local vocabulary and conversational behavior.
- Add configurable review/automatic activation, source evidence, manual editing, disabling and reversible profile/trait snapshots.
- Add optional LivingMemory integration using its existing access, scope and persona policies.
- Add the native AstrBot Panel entry **人格工坊** with Profile, Library, History and Settings views; no previous entry points were renamed or moved.
- Preserve existing host persona prompts and passive message behavior; bound batches, retries, retention and provider concurrency.
